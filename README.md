# Employee Attrition Analysis and Prediction Project

## Business Problem
XYZ Corporation faces a significant challenge with an annual employee attrition rate of approximately 15%. This high turnover rate impacts the company in several ways:
1. **Project Delays**: Loss of skilled employees disrupts project timelines and affects deliverables.
2. **Productivity Loss**: New hires require training and adjustment periods, which lowers overall productivity.
3. **Operational Overhead**: Large recruitment and training teams must be maintained to address the ongoing attrition.

This project addresses these issues by analyzing the factors influencing employee attrition and providing actionable solutions to improve retention and organizational stability.
